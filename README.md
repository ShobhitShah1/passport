## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd passport

# Install dependencies

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Encryption Strategy
- All passwords encrypted using AES-256 before storage
- Master password never stored, only its hash
- Salt-based key derivation for additional security
- Local storage only - no cloud synchronization initially

### Data Protection
- Automatic app locking after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Screen recording prevention
- Screenshot blocking for sensitive screens
- Memory clearing on app backgrounding

### Password Generation
- Minimum 15 characters for generated passwords
- Cryptographically secure random number generation
- Customizable character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Entropy calculation for strength assessment
